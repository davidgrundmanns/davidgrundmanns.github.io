Established scholarship shows that public opinion impacts the outcome of judicial decisionmaking. However, while the focus of judicial politics research rests with outcomes of decisions, the impact of public scrutiny on the whole opinion-formation remains puzzling. I present a novel approach to assess the effects of public scrutiny on opinion writing and the quality of decisions taking judicial opinion-formation seriously. In particular, I analyze judicial argumentation structures, applying natural language processing approaches to judicial politics. I argue that oral hearings increase public attention and moderate the interaction of judges with external actors involved in court procedures. The broader public attention brought to proceedings by oral hearings incentivizes judges to improve the responsiveness of written opinions to arguments presented by external actors. I expect courts to argue each point of the legal discussion in greater detail, by addressing briefs presented to them more closely. I apply my approach to the whole text of decisions published by the German Federal Constitutional Court between 1972 and 2019. The court is a role-model for many highest courts with constitutional review powers and hearings are a common feature of courts’ decision-making.","tags":null,"title":"Do Constitutional Courts Write Their Opinions Differently Under Public Scrutiny?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin G.

In order to answer this question scholarship on the US Supreme Court uses judicial votes but those are often not available in cross-country comparison. We present an approach scaling judicial decisions based on textual features other than votes. In particular, we argue that the legal outcome and tendencies field in briefs by scalable political actors can be used to compute a vote-matrix similar to roll-call data in legislative studies. With the obtained data we are able to estimate location scores employing a standard two-parameter item-response theory model using R STAN. Moreover, computing priors from the known manifesto positions of political actors allows as to meaningful anchor the court’s locations in relation to the political positions in one common policy-space. The procedure applies independently of specific judicial systems but to outline the feasibility, we assess 100 senate decisions by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Our computed spatial measures allow for assessing the judiciary’s willingness to align or diverge from the opinion of governing parties and their political reform. Moreover, the measure helps to validate common theoretical expectations which are based on the assumption that courts are strategic (political) actors.","tags":null,"title":"Judicial Positions on Political Reform.
