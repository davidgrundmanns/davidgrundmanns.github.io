To achieve political compliance with decisions justices need to activate public support. In order to do so, the transparency surrounding decisions is decisive. The more transparent the environment, the more likely the public becomes aware of judicial decisions and potential political threats towards the decisions. While most research regards transparency as a factor either present or absent, we argue that justices can manage the transparency surrounding their decisions through the way they write opinions and press-releases.\nTo assess the argument we analyze the readability of Senate decisions and press releases published by the German Federal Constitutional Court. The findings suggests that the less readable a judicial opinion, the more likely it is supplemented by a press release. Moreover, the easier to read press releases attract more newspaper coverage of opinions than less readable press releases. These findings have major implications for our understanding of transparency surrounding judicial decision-making. Further research is well advised to account for linguistic features when assessing the capabilities of justices to mobilize the public through creating transparency.","tags":[],"title":"Give them the word, they sharpen the sword.

To understand the influence of courts, current research focuses on the result of judicial decisions, namely whether a referral by a plaintiff is justified or not. This project takes a broader perspective on the influence of judicial opinions. Instead of focusing on the general result, it is necessary to account for the substantive variance in opinion-writing. The goal of this project is to use established and novel methods of automated text analysis to map content-related aspects of judicial decisions and relate them to public perception. For example, access to judicial opinions may be easy or difficult, depending on the use of either simple, content-related words or technical jargon specific to a field. Easily accessible opinions are noticed by a larger audience compared to complex opinions that are difficult to process in the media. This implies that judges can influence media coverage through opinion-writing, and this determines to which extent judicial decisions receive public attention. Public attention should not only be observed in traditional media outlets, but also in the way citizens talk about judicial decisions in social media.\nConsequently, assuming that judges do not generate text by chance, judicial opinions are a strategic instrument. On the one hand, judges develop arguments strategically to influence social developments. On the other hand, judges are limited by the political environment and therefore must adapt their arguments strategically.\nText is at the heart of every judicial opinion, regardless of the political or legal system. Therefore, if opinions can be analysed automatically, then the societal influence of courts in different systems can be compared using the same methods. To illustrate this, this project analyses publicly available decisions made by the German Federal Constitutional Court, the US Supreme Court, and the French Conseil Constitutionnel. The three courts differ partly in their structure, their degree of politicisation, and the extent to which they make decisions. By comparing the three courts, this project develops a better understanding of judicial opinion formation in fundamentally different systems. This is important, as courts resolve controversial political and societal issues.\n Research Associate 11.2020 - now ","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"ad88b1cef47ae5837f9d30e41925d168","permalink":"/project/mzes/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mzes/","section":"project","summary":"How do courts exercise political power through opinion-writing?

Established scholarship shows that public opinion impacts the outcome of judicial decisionmaking. However, while the focus of judicial politics research rests with outcomes of decisions, the impact of public scrutiny on the whole opinion-formation remains puzzling. I present a novel approach to assess the effects of public scrutiny on opinion writing and the quality of decisions taking judicial opinion-formation seriously. In particular, I analyze judicial argumentation structures, applying natural language processing approaches to judicial politics. I argue that oral hearings increase public attention and moderate the interaction of judges with external actors involved in court procedures. The broader public attention brought to proceedings by oral hearings incentivizes judges to improve the responsiveness of written opinions to arguments presented by external actors. I expect courts to argue each point of the legal discussion in greater detail, by addressing briefs presented to them more closely. I apply my approach to the whole text of decisions published by the German Federal Constitutional Court between 1972 and 2019. The court is a role-model for many highest courts with constitutional review powers and hearings are a common feature of courts’ decision-making.","tags":["Conference paper"],"title":"Do Constitutional Courts Write Their Opinions Differently Under Public Scrutiny?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin G.

In order to answer this question scholarship on the US Supreme Court uses judicial votes but those are often not available in cross-country comparison. We present an approach scaling judicial decisions based on textual features other than votes. In particular, we argue that the legal outcome and tendencies field in briefs by scalable political actors can be used to compute a vote-matrix similar to roll-call data in legislative studies. With the obtained data we are able to estimate location scores employing a standard two-parameter item-response theory model using R STAN. Moreover, computing priors from the known manifesto positions of political actors allows as to meaningful anchor the court’s locations in relation to the political positions in one common policy-space. The procedure applies independently of specific judicial systems but to outline the feasibility, we assess 100 senate decisions by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Our computed spatial measures allow for assessing the judiciary’s willingness to align or diverge from the opinion of governing parties and their political reform. Moreover, the measure helps to validate common theoretical expectations which are based on the assumption that courts are strategic (political) actors.","tags":["Conference paper"],"title":"Judicial Positions on Political Reform.
